    "* redundancy - In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.\n",
    "* literalness - Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If someone says, The other shoe fell, there is probably no shoe and nothing falling. Formal languages mean exactly what they say."
